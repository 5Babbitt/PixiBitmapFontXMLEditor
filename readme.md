# Pixi BitmapText Font Editor
Check it out here: https://5babbitt.github.io/PixiBitmapFontXMLEditor/

## Description
**Pixi BitmapText Font Editor** is a mouthful... and an online tool that allows you to import a png and an xml file, create and display a [PixiJS v7](https://pixijs.com) BitmapText component, and edit and export the xml configuration in the onsite editor panel.

I made this tool for the tech artists at work because of the amount of time it took to add BitmapFonts to our in-house engine, and to reduce the time it took to make changes.

## Roadmap
As of right now (06/07/2025), the project still has some features to be added, including: 
- syntax highlighting
- xml validation (To check if what you've typed in the editor is valid)
- dynamic text controls
    - configurable counter
- visual document editor
- visualise character pos on texture atlas
- and more...
